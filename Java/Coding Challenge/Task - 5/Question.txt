Harry was studying a magic book that categorizes the magic spells into 3 categories - Good , Worst and Bad. If any spell contains all the vowels in alphabetical order then that spell is categorized as Good. If it contains the vowels in reverse alphabetical order , then that spell is categorized as Worst. All the other spells that do not fall in any of the categories before are categorized as Bad. 
Now Harry tries to evaluate himself by solving a spell categorization exercise at the end of the book , but since he is confused can you help him by solving the problems.

Note: The spell is a word of lower case English alphabets only. If there are no vowels in the string, then the spell is classified as "Good".

Explanation
For case 1, the vowels in the spell are i,o and u and they occur in the alphabetical order in the string, so this is a "Good" string.

For case 2, the vowels in the spell are e and a and they occur in reverse order of the alphabetical order in the string, so this is a "Worst" string.

For case 3, the vowels in the spell are o, a and e and they occur neither in the reverse order nor in the same order as alphabetical, so this is a "Bad" string.
