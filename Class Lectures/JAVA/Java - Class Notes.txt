Arrays
-------
	-collection of elements of similar type.



Method - A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the results to the caller.
	 - Code reusability.
       - Method declaration must be inside the class.


constructor - Each time an object is created using new() keyword at least one constructor is invocked to 
		  assign initial values to the data members of the same class.


Access Specifiers 
**********************************

Access Modifiers					Default	Private	Protected	Public
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inside the class					y		y		y		y
sub class inside same package			y		n		y		y
outside the package				n		n		n		y
within the subclass outside package		n		n		y		y


Packages
***************************
	A package is nothing but a physical folder structure (Directories) that contains
a group of related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages according to their functionality.

Package Naming Convensions
----------------------------

Syntax:
	package companySpecification.CompanyName.ClientName.ProjectName.ModuleName;

	eg:-
		package com.ibm.hdfc.loan.homeloan;

compling java Package in cmd	- javac -d . className.java
To Run java Package in cmd	- java className.java
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


InterFaces in Java
******************************
	An interface can be defined as a container that stores the signatures of the
methods to be implemented in the code segment. It improves the level of Abstraction.

Interface is used with (implements) - keyword.

Abstraction - Hiding the data and Showing the Essential data.

Syntax : 
---------
	abstract class ClassName
	{
		//abstract Methods
		abstract void methodName();
		abstract void methodName();
		//concrete Methods
		void methodName()
		{
			S.O.P("");
		}
	}

Polymorphism
*****************
	Same name with Diffrent defenition within the same class.
	can be implemented through,
		1) method Overloading(Static Polymorphism or Compile Time Polymorphism),
		2) method overriding(Dinamic Polymorphism or Runtime Polymorphism).


Wrapper Class
**************
	A wrapper class wraps (encloses) around a primitive datatypes
and gives it an object appearance.
	
	1) Auto Boxing	- converting primitive Data Type into Object Type
	2) Unboxinfg	- converting Object Type into Primitive Data Type

Exception Handling
***********************

	An exception is a problem that arises during the excecution of a program.
	
		1 ) A user has entered an invalid data
		2 ) File Not Found
		3 ) A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications
		4 ) the JVM has run out of memory

types	
------
	1) Checked Exceptions - it is exception that occures at compile time, also called compile time exceptions.
	2) UnChecked Exceptions - it is an exception that occures at the time of excecutuion. these are also called RunTime Exceptions.

Syntax for try Catch
--------------------

class ClassName
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		try
		{
			//code that may raise exception
		}
		catch(Exception Exception_Object)
		{
			// rest of the program
		}
	}
}
